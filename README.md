# Netlify Content Gate
Gate content and membership on Netlify without a paid plan. Also an example of a Netlify contact form with user registration requirement built in.

Netlify offers user account management with [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/security/secure-access-to-sites/identity/), with [content-gating](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/01/23/getting-started-with-jwt-and-identity/) available on pro plans. This is a free alternative that uses [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) and a Netlify function to gate content until users are approved. Can be used for members only access, or as a platformless "connection request".

[Demo site](https://connect4more.netlify.app/) can be viewed as a part of [Minimal, Responsive, Pure Javascript, Single Page App](https://github.com/i1li/i)
